Ada assumed having math operations + - * /
Ada also assumed having data structures for non-integers. (Bernoulli numbers are rational numbers.)
I was doing research about a simple machine that has only operations + and - and only for integers.
So I was thinking about what it would take to run Ada's program on this simpler machine.
First, multiplication can be implemented with a software subroutine using addition.
Next, rational numbers can be represented with 2 integers, so we can translate the operations
on rational numbers to a sequence of operations on integers.
I add "n" to variable names for numerators and "d" for denominators.
I add "i" to variable names if the integer data structure suffices for that variable.
Lastly, given these previous solutions, the problem of division has disappeared.
(Dividing by 2/3 is just multiplying by 3/2.)
Reducing fractions is required in order to not quickly get into ridiculous
processing times and ridiculous bit lengths per integer.
Without reducing fractions:
Calculating B8 (the 4th non-trivial Bernoulli number) requires integers >32 bits
and ~20 seconds of processing time on a core i7.
Calculating B10 (the 5th non-trivial Bernoulli number) requires integers >64 bits
and I don't know how much processing time. I stopped it at 7 hours.
The machine I was thinking of is 8 bits, so I would like to see how far I can get with that.
Obviously B12 (-691 / 2730) has both a numerator and denominator that don't fit in 8 bits.
So I guess B10 is the goal.
Reducing fractions brings back the problem of division that had disappeared.
But that's not hard to implement in software, just like multiplication.
We can get to B6 by simply reducing some of the fractions after calculating them.
But that's not enough for B8 and B10.
We'll need another subroutine for adding 2 fractions.
The most common (and most efficient on most computers) method for finding
the lowest common denominator involves multiplying the denominators,
but that completely defeats the purpose if we need to stay in 8 bits.
On this machine it is more efficient to find the lowest common denominator in the
process of adding the fractions, instead of as a first step to adding the fractions.
In the calculations of B10, there's one point when the multiplication of 2 fractions
is 7/5 * 30/1 = 210/5.
210 is an overflow in 8-bit signed integers.
The result can be reduced to fit in 8 bits (42/1), but it can't be reduced IN 8 bits.
Overflow can be avoided by doing a cross-reduction before the multiplication.
Reduce 30/5 and 7/1 to 6/1 and 7/1, then multiply to get the already reduced 42/1.
I guess it's kind of cheating to write the program already knowing all the results
of everything it needs to do, but I'm only doing this cross-reduction for the one
place where I know it would otherwise overflow.
It could be done for every fraction multiplication, but in most places
I think it would add more memory requirements and processing for no benefit.
I'm not sure about that. It could be less processing in some cases,
but it would add more memory requirements either way.
